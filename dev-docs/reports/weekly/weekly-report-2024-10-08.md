# New tasks

# What worked this week?

- We leverage some of the team member (Chin / Jason) experiences in setting up the Python Project and also GitHub Project tracker.
- We have defined the communication channel and location (days/hours) to meet for standup and weekly meeting, which gives us time to share our progress and keep us accountable.

# What did not work this week?

- We had new team member this week and spent some time in helping new member up to speed with what we previously discussed before.
- The ignore file path for build_test to main doesn't work. It's not currently needed for now as we haven't develop any code, but we will implement it in the future.
