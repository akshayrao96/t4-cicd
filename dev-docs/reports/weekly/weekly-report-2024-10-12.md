# Week 5 (Oct 8 - Oct 12)

## Summary

Meeting on 8th and 11th October to monitor and tackle issues. Following are notes from meeting:

- Shifted focus from building the MVP to preparing for the demo next week.
- Discussed and divided the tasks related to additional files and methods needed for [Requirement 2](https://neu-seattle.gitlab.io/asd/cs6510f24/CS6510-F24/main/project/requirements.html#_requirements_iteration_2).
- Clarified the workflow from the CLI Controller to handling repository and configuration file checks.
- Aligned on the API for Controller and ConfigChecker.
- Clarified the differences in the CLI for Base Command, Config Management, and Pipeline Management.

We decided to do a team code walk on 14th on our development branch to make sure the uses case will be well presenting on class.

# What worked this week?

- Chin : interaction diagram and design doc to align everyone's understanding on the same page.

# What did not work this week?

- Chin : Before the interaction diagram was drafted, everyone has their own understanding on how the system should run. Furthermore, previous discussions were not documented and the discussions kind of recycling itself.

# Design updates
